# Beltmatic_Operation_Optimizer

This web application helps you find a somewhat optimal solution (not the global optimum due to execution time considerations and the effectiveness of the current algorithm) for a target number using a weighted Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

The optimization prioritizes the number of operations (75%) and the number of unique nodes (25%), as it is generally easier to find and connect one more node than to perform an additional operation.

You can try it [here]()!

## Usage

Simply insert the number you are trying to creat, the max number unlocked and select the operations available at the moment.

### Output

As you can see in the results is presented the optimized equation, the number of operations and the number of nodes.
